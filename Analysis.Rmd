## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

data <- read.csv("Data.csv")
glimpse(data)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

df <- data %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(likes, comments, shares)

ggpairs(df)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

df2 <- data %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(likes, comments, shares, does_it_have_tagged, does_it_have_a_link) %>% 
  mutate(does_it_have_tagged = case_when(
    does_it_have_tagged == "Yes" ~ 1,
    does_it_have_tagged == "No" ~ 0
  ))  %>% 
    mutate(does_it_have_a_link = case_when(
    does_it_have_a_link == "Yes" ~ 1,
    does_it_have_a_link == "No" ~ 0
  ))   

ggpairs(df2)
  
```
